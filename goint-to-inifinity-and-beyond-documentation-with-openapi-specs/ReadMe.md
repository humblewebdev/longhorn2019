### Mocking and Feedback
  - OpenApi document mocks the request and response
    - Prism is a mock server
    - If you use or build internal APIs(including libraries/SDKs),
      - You can
        - Build faster
        - Parallelize development
        - more options
    - If you write docs or tutorials, 
        - you can
            - Start writing sooner
            - Give feedback
            - Have interactive docs
