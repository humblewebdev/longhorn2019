### The How of doing things as a developer
    - Ask/answer questions
    - How I take ownership
    - how I participated in code reviews
    - how I worked with the team

#### Asking a question
    - Is that the best answer to your question
    - are there better answers
    - why is the other answers better
    - used internet to update my skills (Did the same thing but in different ways)


#### Answer a question
    - Just answer the question or provide the reasoning for the answer
    - Explain opinions from personal experiences
    - When asking a question take time to analyze the question
    - Think about why they are asking me the question they're asking me.
    - Maybe start some dialogue to find out why the question is being asked.
    - Help understand the question they're trying to ask
    - Understand the question from the perspective of the "asker"

#### What does it mean to take Ownership?

    - You dont wait until you stuggle and stuggle and you didnt figure it out
    - Take a large task and break it up into smaller task
    - Does the deadline seem feasible

#### How I participate in code reviews?
    - Are they aware of it
    - I need you to do this

### Participating in a code review
    - teach implementation/code standards/business logic etc
    - When participating in code review being a reviewer/reviewee
        - put more effort in the comments is a means of taking responsibility to 
            be a good team member
        - Stating why to make a change in a code review and why it may be a better
            choice. Add links to why its a better choice.  You will be more likely
            to get a positive result.
    ##### Purpose of code review
        - Validating the design and implementation
        - mainting consistency in implementation styles among the developers
        - finding logical errors
        - Identifying more efficient ways of completingn any task
        - mentorship; kess experieced developers learn from more experienced 
            developers
        - Knowledge sharing

    ##### Making Code review commens
        - Formulate your feedback from your point of view by expressing your personal
            thoughts, feelings, and impressions by using I-statement such as "I suggest"
        - Talk about code, not the developer, by using the phrases such as "The code is"
        - Remember there are different solutions to a problem, be open to accepting 
            solutions that may differ from preconceived ideas of you own
        - Dont criticize every line of code

    ##### Receiving Code REview Comments
        - Have an open and humble mindset about the feedback; no matter how goo you 
            are, you can still learn and improve
        - You are note your code; don't judge your self-worth based on the review
        - code reviews are a discussion; you are free to disagree with comments
        - focus responses to comments on the code and not on the reviewer
        - Remember the goal is to create high quality software.

    ### Working with others
