## The How of doing things as a developer
* how asked and answered questions
* how took ownership of taks
* how participated in code review
* how worked with others

## Asking questions
* Go beyond simply getting the answer
* Is best answer?
* Other options?
* Why?
* Broaden and deepen your knowledge which makes you more valuable to company, and more marketable

## Answering questions
* Go beyond giving a simple/quick answer
* Give reasoning behind answer
* Give perspective
* Take time to analyze question being asked
	* Why are they asking the question?
	* Does it make sense they are asking me?
	* Are they grasping at straws because they don’t know what to ask?
	* Ask questions to determine the underlying question they need answered.

## Take ownership
* Take responsibility to understand the scope of your task
* Determine what knowledge you are missing to complete task
* Understanding deadline and effort needed to meet the deadline
* Provide accurate status on what needs to be done
* Knowing when to ask for help
* Inform management when encountering blockers
* Figure out subtasks
	* Is the deadline feasible
* Stay on top of task even while it is others’ hands (eg. code reviewers or qe/qa)
* Examples of not being responsible
	* Lack of interest in assignment
	* Missing deadlines
	* Complaining about other team members
	* Blaming others for msitakes
	* Making excuses for failings
	* Negative attitude
	* Taking constructive criticism personally

## Participating in Code Reviews
* Opportunity for best practices
* Consider target audience (author of code and other reviews and junior devs) -- put more effort into your comments
* Write comments in such a way as to make an impression while informing
* Purpose of code reviews
	* Validating the design and implementation of features
	* Maintain consistency in implementation styles among the developers
	* Finding logical errors
	* Identitfying more efficient ways of completing any task
	* Mentorship; less expirienced developers learn from more experienced developers
	* Knowledge sharing
* Making Code Review Comments
	* Formulate your feedback from your point of view by expressing your personal thoughts , feelings, and impressions by using I-statements such as "I suggest"
	* Talk about code, not the developer, by using phrases such as "the code is..."
	* Remember there are different solutions to a problem, be open to accepting solutions that may differ from preconceived ideas of your own
	* Don’t criticize every line of code
	* Make positive comments
* Reveiving Code Review Comments
	* Have an open and humble mindset about the feedback; no matter how good you are, you can still learn and improve
	* You are not your code; don’t judge your self-worth based on the review
	* Code reviews are a discussion; you are free to disagree with comments
	* Focus responses to comments on the code and not on the reviewer
	* Remember the goal is to create high quality software

## Working with others
* How can you be a team leader if you can’t wok well with others?
* Collaboration skills
	* Ability to communicate your own thoughts, ideas, and questions
	* Ability to listen to thoughts ideas, and questions of others
	* Negotiate and compromise
	* Respect and tolerance
	* Recognition of contributions by others
	* Reliability
