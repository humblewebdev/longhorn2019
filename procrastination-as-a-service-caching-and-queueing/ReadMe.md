# Procrastination As A Service: Caching & Queueing by Lawrence Shea

## Redis

* Works as a cache, message broker, etc.

## Caching

* Is fast

## Where is caching useful?

* When you need to do slow operations
* When it is okay to have delayed data

## Cron jobs can give a little more performance

## Work is hard. Do less of it, later.

## Job queues
* Instant success message
* Queue jobs very fast
* Work in the background
* Retry failed jobs
* 202 - Accepted HTTP Status Code

## Fault tolerance for queues - users still get good experience

## When to queue?
* All the time. 
* Actively procrastinate
